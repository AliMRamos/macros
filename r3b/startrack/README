Simulation:

	Edit and adjust the file "r3bsim.C" for your specific setup and event generator, then run:

	root -l r3bsim.C

Analysis:

	For pure simulations:

		The tracks are reconstructed in one step with: 
		root -l 
		.L analysLampShadeSpec1Tree.C
		analysEvents(1,"r3bsim.root","outputFileName.root") -> this create the output file called startrackerAnaDigit.root with position (x,y,z) of pixel hit and reconstructed theta and phi angles, AND INVARIANT MASS 


		or in 2 steps, making use of the R3BSTaRTraHitFinder class via:
		root -l StarTrackAna.C  -> this create the output file called startrackerAna.root with position (x,y,z) of pixel hit and reconstructed theta and phi angles.
		root -l checkResults.C  -> reads the "startrackerAnaDigit.root" and reconstruct invariant mass. !!TODO!!




	For simulated raw data:
	     
		The tracks are reconstructed in 2 steps with: 

		root -l StarTrackAnaDigit.C   -> reads the r3bsim.root output file and creates a new output tree called "startrackerAnaDigit.root" 
		     			      	 with RAW information similar to the DAQ output

		root -l RecResults.C        -> reads the "startrackerAnaDigit.root" and reconstruct tracks and other physical observables from the detector Id, strip ID, energy loss and time
